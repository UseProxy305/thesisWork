Foreground calibration:

	It is for errors constant over time. 
	Factory errors can be gone.
	Coefficients is fused into Non volatile memory. 
	The system can't be used during foreground calibration.

	Self-calibration:
		Allow the user to start a calibration process.
		Still a foreground calibration

Background Calibration:
	
	Correlation-based Background calibration:
		Use the Pseudo-random noise signal to see how much an error is
		Use an LMS to find the gain error
			Ge​[n+1]=Ge​[n]+μ*Vd​[n]*(VR​[n]−Vd​[n]*Ge​[n])

		Large mu => fast convergence but low accuracy
		Small mu => slow convergence but high accuracy

	Feed-forward correlation:
		Waits for collecting all samples and calculates the scorrelation immediately after sampling is done
		Gives jump updates
		Faster but less smooth since no feedback is present
