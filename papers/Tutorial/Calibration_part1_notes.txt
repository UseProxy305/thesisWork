	- Laser Trimming: In R-2R ladder systems, it is required to have a high precision. If you use laser trimming based on a reference (I^T in the paper), you can cut / trim a resistor based on resulting values. Drawback is having a long and costly process.

	- Fuse Trimming: Not sure how it works. Compared to Laser trimming,
